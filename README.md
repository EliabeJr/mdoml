# mdoml

**mdoml**, or mdo markup language, is an experiment that augments HTML5's language with additional custom elements from some of the interface design's most common patterns. It attempts to answer the question, *What if could HTML as a language look like if it had support for our most beloved components?*

For more information, [see the docs and examples](http://mdo.github.io/mdoml).
