# mdoml

What if you could augment HTML5's current set of elements with your own? Well, as it turns out, you can. **mdoml** is an experiment in creating custom HTML elements based on today's most common interface design components.

Is this a bad idea? Maybe, but that depends on how you look at it. Sure, it doesn't validate, but it does create a more approachable component-based design system. No more rules around writing classes a certain wayâ€”just create the components.

For more information, [see the docs and examples](http://mdo.github.io/mdoml).

## Local development

This repo is a Jekyll site, so you'll need that installed before firing it up locally. Once you're set, just start a local server with `jekyll serve` and head to `http://localhost:4000/mdoml/`.
